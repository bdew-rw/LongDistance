This mod allows colonists that have relationships (both romantic and famillial) with pawns from other factions to invite them to join the colony.

You will need a working comms console to be able to contact the other pawn. Select your colonist and right click the console to initiate the call.

The invited pawn might decide to join or reject the offer (success chance depends on opinion, social skill of the inviter, and faction standings).

If the invited pawn decides to join it might cause faction relations to change, for better or worse.

On the other hand a rejection might cause a breakup (romantic relationships only).

You can also use it to remotely break up in case you're not interested in them joining.

Requires HugsLib - https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=818773962
